# Antibacterial_SOPs
Drug resistance often develops multiple times, especially in the case of antibiotic resistance. Thus, understanding the origins of these can help us know how resistance emerges and spreads. This Task will assess the number of origins for different drug-resistance alleles. If mutations emerge multiple times, this has implications for H. pylori infection control programs, as containment becomes less feasible compared to a single origin with spread. 
The SOPs are from ongoing collaborative project entitled 'The potential of bacteriophages targeting multidrug-resistant Helicobacter pylori strain' between Alfizah Hanafiah (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia), Asif Sukri (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia), Bruno Lopes (Teesside University, UK), Mostafa Rateb (University of the West of Scotland, UK), and Emile Chimusa (Northumbria University, UK)
